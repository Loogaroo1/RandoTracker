# RandoTracker

This is a location and item tracker for The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Randomizer.

The purpose of this application is to give the user a simple rundown of the item locations that are available to the player with their given inventory. This tracker also shows the individual chests inside each dungeon for the user to check off as they progress, as certain dungeons can be partially cleared depending on what the user has.

For dungeon usage:
Any chest or boss that is either definitely open to the player or potentially open depending on inventory and dungeon item distribution will be clickable. Hover over the button to get an image context of where the chest is located within the dungeon. (Chests are generally placed in order of when you will logically encounter them.) If a chest or boss has the potential to be blocked, a question mark will appear over it but it can still be clicked. (Example: without the boots, several chests in Desert Palace may or may not be available depending on whether a key is on the torch.) If a chest or boss can be reached through a sequence break, an icon of the item that's being skipped will appear over the chest or boss. (Example: without the lamp, the big key chest and the boss of Eastern Palace would have to be dark-navigated.) For chests or bosses that involve taking damage without certain items - such as the Cape or Mirror Shield - a heart icon will appear over the button.

Next to each dungeon label is a button that can be clicked to alternate between rewards for that dungeon: Crystal, Fat Fairy Crystal (red), non-Green Pendant, Green Pendant. Also next to Misery Mire and Turtle Rock are buttons that alternate between the three medallions to indicate what is needed to open up that dungeon. (Note that if the player has all three medallions, you don't need to indicate which one opens MM or TR.) Also, you can click on the labels themselves to turn them green; this is generally useful to indicate that all prizes have been obtained from that dungeon and you don't need to return.

For overworld usage:
Any location that is open to the player is seen as a white button. Locations that are either partially blocked depending on inventory (usually bombs) are yellow. Locations that require a sequence break (Example: Hobo without flippers) are orange. Locations that are inaccessible are red and unclickable.

Special thanks to the developer community on the ALTTP Discord for helping me bring this to you guys.
