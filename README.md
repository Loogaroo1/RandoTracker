# RandoTracker

This is a location and item tracker for The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Randomizer.

The purpose of this application is to give the user a simple rundown of the item locations that are available to the player with their given inventory. This tracker also shows the individual chests inside each dungeon for the user to check off as they progress, as certain dungeons can be partially cleared depending on what the user has.

For dungeon usage:
Any chest or boss that is either definitely open to the player or potentially open depending on inventory and dungeon item distribution will be clickable. Hover over the button to get an image context of where the chest is located within the dungeon. (Chests are generally placed in order of when you will logically encounter them.) If a chest or boss has the potential to be blocked, a question mark will appear over it but it can still be clicked. (Example: without the boots, several chests in Desert Palace may or may not be available depending on whether a key is on the torch.) If a chest or boss can be reached through a sequence break, an icon of the item that's being skipped will appear over the chest or boss. (Example: without the lamp, the big key chest and the boss of Eastern Palace would have to be dark-navigated.) For chests or bosses that involve taking damage without certain items - such as the Cape or Mirror Shield - a heart icon will appear over the button.

For overworld usage:
Any location that is open to the player is seen as a white button. Locations that are either partially blocked depending on inventory (usually bombs) are yellow. Locations that require a sequence break (Example: Hobo without flippers) are orange. Locations that are inaccessible are red and unclickable.

Special thanks to the developer community on the ALTTP Discord for helping me bring this to you guys.
